# Commit Guidelines
Mostly reasonable guidelines for commit messages.

## Commit Message Format
Commit messages consist of a [message](#message), [description](#description)
and [related](#related).

```
<message>

<description>

<related>
```

A [message](#message) consists of a [type](#type), [scope](#scope), and
[subject](#subject).

No line should be longer than 80 characters long, for optimal github viewing.

## Message
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Examples: `refactor(plans#show): remove 1 of 4 templating languages`

### Type
* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `format`: Change not affecting the **meaning** of code (white-space, formatting, etc)
* `docs`: Documentation-**only** change
* `style`: Stylesheet-**only** change
* `refactor`: Change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* `perf`: Change that improves performance
* `test`: Addition of a missing test
* `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying the site of the commit change. For
example `plans#show`, `PlanPerson`, `LiveChatMessageList`, `.tab-list`, etc...

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't use capitalize first letters
* don't use trailing punctuation (.)

### Description
Just as in the [subject](#subject), use the imperative, present tense: "change"
not "changed" nor "changes" The body should include the motivation for the
change.

### Related
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is the
place to reference Trello cards, or GitHub issues that the commit **Closes**.
